<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>Case Study: The art teacher needs a carry-all for brushes and paints. She says, “I want it to fit under my</p><p>desk, but I forgot to mention that until after your first draft.” Students had originally drawn a tall, multi-level</p><p>box. Realizing this mistake, they must redesign. They decide to lower the height and add compartments.</p>

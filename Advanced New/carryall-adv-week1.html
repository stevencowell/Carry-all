<summary><b>Week 1: Safety Scenarios</b></summary>
<article>
<h4>Case Study / Scenario</h4>
<p>Case Study: A student in the woodshop quickly removed her safety glasses “just for a second” to check a</p><p>measurement. Suddenly, a small wood chip flew toward her eye and caused pain. She learned the hard way</p><p>that even a brief lapse is dangerous. From then on, her class enforced a strict rule: no cutting or sanding</p><p>without goggles on.</p>

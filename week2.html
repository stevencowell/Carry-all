      <h2>Week 2: Australia’s First Technologists – Woodworking Traditions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>This week we’re stepping back—way back—to explore some of the world’s oldest and most sustainable woodworking traditions. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have been using timber technologies for tens of thousands of years. Their work with wood was more than practical—it was deeply connected to Country, culture, and community.</p>
      <h3>Woodworking with Respect and Sustainability</h3>
      <p>For First Nations Australians, tools weren’t just functional—they were part of a wider system that linked people to the land. Every tree cut had a purpose, and every tool was made with precision and care using what was available in that specific Country.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stone axes and adzes, for cutting and shaping timber</li>
        <li>Shell or stone scrapers, for smoothing surfaces</li>
        <li>Natural adhesives, like spinifex resin, used to attach stone tools to wooden handles (hafting)</li>
        <li>Fire shaping, used to soften and form timber into canoes, coolamons, and shields</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nothing was wasted, and tools were often multi-functional—for example, a spear-thrower (woomera) could also be used for carrying items or making fire.</p>
      <h3>Timber Knowledge: Working with the Right Tree</h3>
      <p>Each region had its own preferred timbers based on the properties needed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mulga (Acacia aneura) – dense and strong, for hunting tools and clubs</li>
        <li>Eucalyptus – tough and flexible, for shields, didgeridoos, and bark canoes</li>
        <li>Blackwood – smooth and resilient, for finely shaped tools</li>
        <li>Fig tree roots – lightweight, ideal for large shields in Northern Australia</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technology That’s More Than Tools</h3>
      <p>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander technology was holistic. It included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design thinking, shown in multifunctional tools</li>
        <li>Deep ecological knowledge, passed through generations</li>
        <li>Efficient construction, using minimal resources for maximum function</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Design Inspiration</h3>
      <p>As you work on your Carry-all, think about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using materials respectfully—avoid waste where possible</li>
        <li>Designing for function—does every part serve a purpose?</li>
        <li>Creating something that lasts—how strong is your joint? Could it be handed down?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Discussion Starters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Why is it important to study these woodworking practices in a modern course?</li>
        <li>What lessons can we take from traditional tool design?</li>
        <li>How has your understanding of timber selection changed?</li>
      </ul>
